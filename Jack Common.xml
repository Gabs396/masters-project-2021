                <p>The following comes from an unpublished diary belonging to the Jack Common
                    Archive</p>
            </publicationStmt>
            <sourceDesc>
                <p>which is currently being held by Newcastle University, in their Special

                <p>The goal of this project is to eventually have the entirety of the Jack Common
                    Archive digitised so that it can be easily accessed by individuals who may have
                    never come across it otherwise.</p>

            <editorialDecl>
                <p>The following provides both a semi-diplomatic transcription and a modernised
                    transcription. The semi-diplomatic transcription retains the majority of Jack
                    Common's original writing conventions, allowing readers to engage with the text
                    as if it were original, except for a few editorial additions. The modernised
                    transcription makes a number of changes for the purpose of improved readability
                    and accessibility. The semi-diplomatic transcription keeps the original
                    spelling, punctuation and capitlisation of the source text, whereas the
                    modernised version corrects all three. The modernised transcription uses
                    elements such as: &quot;sic&quot;,&quot;corr&quot;,&quot;supplied&quot; and
                    &quot;choice&quot; to do this. Page breaks, line breaks, paragraphs, authorial
                    additions and deletions in both the semi-diplomatic and modernised
                    transcriptions are recorded exactly as they appear in the source text, as they
                    do not have a significant impact on readability, and it keeps both
                    transcriptions as visually similar to the original as possible. However, a
                    number of editorial additions have been made and appear in both transcriptions.
                    Words which have been fully transcribed, but without full confidence, have been
                    indicated with the element &quot;unclear&quot; and the value
                    &quot;illegible&quot;, words which have been partially transcribed have been
                    indicated with the element &quot;gap&quot;, alongside an indication of the
                    extent, and authorial deletions which could not be transcribed successfully have
                    been indicated with the self-closing element &quot;gap&quot; and the value
                    &quot;deleted&quot;.</p>
